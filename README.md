# CodSoft Internship Tasks

I had the privilege of participating in a dynamic internship at CodSoft, where I worked on five diverse projects. These projects allowed me to gain practical experience in various areas of data science and machine learning. Each task presented unique challenges and opportunities, contributing to a holistic learning experience.

## Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction
For Task 1, I tackled the Titanic Survival Prediction challenge. The goal was to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic beginner project used the Titanic dataset, which contains information about individual passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. I employed a Logistic Regression model to make predictions.

## Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Task 2 involved building a model to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. I used regression techniques to address this problem. The project allowed me to analyze historical movie data, perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and create a machine learning model for rating estimation. To tackle this, I employed the XGBoost Regressor.

## Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification
In Task 3, the goal was to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris Flower dataset, which consists of three species, was used for this classification task. The dataset allowed me to explore introductory classification methods, and I used Logistic Regression for classification in this task.

## Task 4 - Sales Prediction Using Python
Task 4 revolved around sales prediction using Python. Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase. I utilized machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret data, allowing me to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. For this regression task, I chose the Random Forest Regressor.

## Task 5 - Credit Card Fraud Detection
In Task 5, I built a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This project required preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance, and using classification algorithms. I chose Logistic Regression as the classification algorithm for this critical task.
